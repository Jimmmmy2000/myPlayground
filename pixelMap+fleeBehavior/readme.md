Pretty straight forward way to create a pixel map
but instead of updating the pixels, it's sending the position
and radius of each circle to an array as a 3D vector.

Then it's the same system as Shiffman Nature of Code : https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/

Have fun with this and let me know if you make anything cool with this :)
